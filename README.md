# entropy_based_packer_detection

This is the implementation of the paper: "An Entropy-Based Solution for Identifying Android Packers". The implementation and data has been updated after the submission.

By sharing this work, we hope to motivate other researchers on finding interesting solution on packer identification.

## HOW TO RUN

Just install Jupyter notebook and look at the config files.

# THIS WORK IS MOTIVATED BY THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH: 
 + APKiD: Android Application Identifier for Packers, Protectors, Obfuscators and Oddities - PEiD for Android (by RedNaga group)
 + Using Entropy Analysis to Find Encrypted and Packed Malware (by Robert Lyda and James Hamrock)
